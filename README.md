# Spell Checker

## Overview
A spell checker that combines a **language model** with **error correction** using Noisy Channel 
framework and the Norvig spell checker.. It suggests the most probable spelling corrections by considering
both word context and common errors (insertions, deletions, etc.).

## Features
- **Language Model (LM):** Trained on a corpus to predict word sequences.
- **Error Model:** Uses confusion matrices to model common spelling errors.
- **Context-Aware:** Suggests corrections based on N-gram.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alonfridental/NLP-Project---Spell-Checker.git

## Evaluation
